- 👋 Hi, I’m @dr3w45
- 👀 I’m a Sofware Hacking Practitioner
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and AvtiVirus Evasion Techniques
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to bypassing security
- 📫 I'm into:
-   Bash
-   Python
-   PHP
-   Microsoft Visual Studio
-   Hack the Box and any video put out by 'ippsec' (my man crush)
-   Debian Linux, Kali linux, Raspberry Pi, Windows 11 and Apple products

I would love to make new connections with anybody into Penetration Testing or Computer Hacking in general.  White Hat, Grey Hat or Black Hat.  I can learn from anybody
